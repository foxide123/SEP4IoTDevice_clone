# Setting up the project
In order to run the tests make sure you have installed:
- PlatformIO extension
- CMake extension

## Step-by-step

!!! If you open src files outside of platformio project there will be many include errors.
Don't worry just close the file and if you want to modify it do it from platformio project

1. Start VSCode and press the *PlatformIO* icon on the left.

2. Select blue button *Pick a folder*

3. Select target folder (SEP4IoTDevice/target)

4. Now you should wait until the 'initializing platform io' is done.
    There should be '.pio' folder visible at that point

5. Go back to the root folder (SEP4IoTDevice)

6. Now you should wait until VSC configures the project

7. Click on the play button at the bottom. Play button is marked on the below image.
